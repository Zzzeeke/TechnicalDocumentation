            and mysterious "Traveler" from another world who arrives in the land of Teyvat. After trying
            to go to an another adventure together with your twin, you were blocked by an Unknown God 
            who'm you and your twin try to defeat it. But as misfortune occurs your twin got captured,
            and you were been sealed for over 500 years. After waking up on a beach you set off on a quest
            to find your lost twin and gaining your original powers by absorbing the 7 elements of the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 7 seven elements of the world that you can absorb and use in battle are as follows: 
            Anemo which means Wind, Geo which means Earth, Electro which mean Lightning, Dendro which
            means Plants/Trees, Hydro which means Water, Pyro which is Fire, and lastly Cryo which means
            Ice.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Prologue</b>
              <p>You set foot on the Land of Freedom which is associated by the Anemo element. In this land
              the people and it's local god believe that you must be free as the wind. Thus the god of Anemo
              granted its people Freedom, thus the Crown of the North is not under any rulership, but what
              does Freedom truly means if Demanded to by a God.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Chapter 1</b>
              <p>As you continue your journey to find your twin you get in the Land of Contracts/Commerce.
                Also known as the heart of whole Teyvat because the currency that all people of this
                world is created by the Geo Archon by its divine power. But what could even a god do
                if he too could not escape the inevitable death. In the end he will sign the contract
                to end all contract.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Chapter 2</b>
              <p>After being a hero in the Land of Commerce you arrive at the Nation of Eternity. In 
                this nation of Thunder and Lightning their local deity seeks only Eternity traumatized by her   
                past grief after loosing her sister in the Archon war, for she belives
                that Eternity are you closest to the Heavenly Principles. For that she restricts anyone from
                entering and exiting her nation in order to protect them from divine judgement greater than her.
                But what do mortals see of the eternity chased after by their god, thus retaliating to be
                free from her strict grasp and show her that a nation can move on even not violating
                the Heavenly Principles. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Chapter 3</b>
              <p>After you opened the heart and mind of the god of thunder you continue to seek answers
                behind your twin's location your next objective is to go and adventure on the Land of Wisdom. 
                In the land of wisdom there is a push for folly, yet the god of Wisdom makes no argument against
                it. After entering the City of Scholars you quickly learned the dark secrets kept by the nation
                who's governance is centralized by an Academy. Rejecting their own god yet creating another god
                which is the pinnacle of human wisdom. For the God of Wisdom's enemy is wisdom itself thus as
                granting you the title of The First sage and the god's permission it is in your hands to give 
                divine punishment for those who oposed their god.

          <p>
            There are three types of Wishing System: Limited-Event Caharacter Banner, Limited-Event Weapon 
            Banner, and Permanent Banner. You can win a 50% chance on these banners, loosing the 50%
            on the limited time events gives you a random 5 stars character or weapon. When you lost
            the 50-50 chance you will get the character/weapon you want on your next set of wishes. 
            There is also a pity or a counter system which counts how many you wished so far. If you
            wished for 75th time your 50-50 chance begins.         
          </p>

          <p>
            The limited-event character wish banner features newly released characters of the game or
            returning characters. Grab the chance to wish on them while you still can.
            The same implies to the limited-event weapon wish banner features the limited-event character's 
            best in slot weapons. Which can empower them more and make your team stronger against the enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The permanent event wish banner has no time limit, as the name suggests it is permanent. You could
            5 stars character and weapons. The one you could lose on the limited-event wish banners
            are also available here with only 1% of 12 odds.

        <article>
          <p>Artifacts are relics to boost your character's power and make them even more stronger.
            There is a RNG (random number generator) on obtaining stats on your artifacts. You could
            receive Atk%, Def%, Hp%, or elemental % artifacts these rng drop rates can be both a blessing or
            a curse to your characters making them either strong or stagnant.
          </p>
          <p>Specific Artifacts for Specific Elements are sealed through domains. For example Dendro
            element characters prefer the Deepwood Memories artifact series because it bossts their 
            damage and overall power.

          <p>
            For those who want some Sims 4 vibe of gaming Genshin also provides that type of game with their 
            very own Housing System obtained after finishing a quest. The housing system is inside a magical
            teapot similar to a genie's lamp. But of course you need to collect materials outside your
            teapot.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consequently, you can earn in-game currencies inside of your teapot by building a custom
            blueprint for your characters. They can give your gems in exchange for your hard work
            building their prefered envireonment of living.
